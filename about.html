            <h4>ABOUT SMILE AGAIN </h4>
            <h3>Our Story</h3>
            <p class="small">
With so much on the plates of busy people in today’s busy world, many take their dental health for granted. Squeezing in an afternoon teeth cleaning after Thursday’s power lunch can feel impossible. So, when it comes to smiles or schedules, most people don’t choose to sit in a dentist’s chair. What if you didn’t have to choose? Dental services should work with you—not against you.
Convenient, transparent service is what so many people are missing from their dentist. You deserve the
very best dental care—but the dental industry just doesn’t work for you. We are smile again—and we’re the
people’s dentist. We’re revolutionizing dental care to put you at the very center—and to bring care to
more people than ever before.</p>
<h3>Dental for
the people</h3>

            <p> Smile again is a new kind of dental experience—one that’s designed around you. We offer convenient,
transparent service and world-class dental care. But we’re so much more than that. We’re a way to ensure
everyone has access to the high-quality dental care they deserve.
We believe dental care should be convenient and we’re on a mission to make that happen.
If you’re looking for a new kind of dental experience—one that’s designed around you—you’ve come to
the right place.</p> <br>
